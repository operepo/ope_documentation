# Overview - OPE (Open Prison Education)
It is a struggle to install and manage online services in an offline world. Simple things like updates or installing new packages becomes a hassle. We work in highly secure prison environments where internet is not available. 

The goal here is to create a tool where we can package apps that can be easily copied to a USB drive, then pushed to a server in the offline environment.

This project consists of building and staging of apps, easy deployment into facilities, and offline laptops that students can take back to their unit to continue their school work.

# Project Goals

1) Create a place for skilled IT personnel to stage and place apps that are ready to deploy

2) Limit the need for skilled IT personnel to deal with the actual deployment process

3) Provide laptop images that can sync to a learning management system, credential for an individual student, and apply security settings to keep the system secure during use

# Deployment Steps

1) Skilled IT personnel create docker apps and setup code to sync these apps and app data to a device (e.g. USB drive or Laptop)

2) Sync USB drive in online or offline mode with a few button clicks - Goal is to have non IT personnel do this

3) Image laptops and credential them for individual students - Goal is non IT personnel or local IT personnel to be able to do this easily

4) Student brings laptop to docking station to sync with learning management system - download materials, upload completed work

# Tech Details

## Micro Service Architecture
We utilize Docker containers for micro services. You will need a machine that can run docker containers on the outside to build and setup your services, and a docker machine on the inside to transfer images and data to.

```

## Getting Started
1. Get a linux distro with docker installed in both your online and offline servers:
   - Linux image ready to go (ISO - burn to DVD): http://correctionsed.com/updates/OPE_Docker.x86_64-0.0.10.preload.iso
   (broken link https://susestudio.com/a/P08rUy/ope-docker)
   - Assign a static IP address to each server and write it down
   - Login with root (password: changeme) and use the passwd utility to change to a secure password

2. From online computer, download the OPE Git project at: https://github.com/operepo/ope
   - From the GREEN button, click and choose "Download Zip".
   - Unzip this onto your USB drive into a folder called ope (e.g. e:\ope )
   
3. Run the SyncApp.exe app
   - In the ope folder, you should see a folder called SyncApp. Run the SyncApp.exe file from there

4. Configure your settings
   - Make sure you put in the correct IP for each server as well as the password you set

5. Run Online
   - Choose the online button, then click Run. This will start pulling in the selected apps and syncing them to the USB drive

6. Unplug, take USB drive to offline server, the choose the Offline option and run it
   - This will push the apps/data on the USB drive to the offline server

7. Repeat online/offline as often as needed

8. Setup DNS forwarder to .ed domain name to the static IP of the server. This forwards all DNS queries for the .ed domain to the docker apps to resolve DNS automatically
   - For Active Directory DNS - add a conditional forwarder for the domain ed -> to the static IP (put in the correct IP for the online or offline server)
   - For Linux DNS users, a wildcard DNS should work too if you don't know how to do a conditional forwarder

  
   
   
   
## Getting Started - Developers
Use this method to get everything ready to do development.

1. Get a linux distro with docker installed in both your online and offline servers:
   - Linux image ready to go (ISO - burn to DVD): https://susestudio.com/a/P08rUy/ope-docker
   - Assign a static IP address to each server and write it down

2. Install Git

3. Python 2.7.? and needed libraries (python.org - choose 2.7? MSI installer)
   - NOTE: On the options page of the install, make sure "Add Python to Path" is selected
   - Run the InstallPythonModules.cmd batch file as admin to install all the needed python modules
   
4. Clone the OPE project into a folder on your computer.
   - From the command line, CD to the folder you want to be in: cd git_projects
   - Clone the rep to your computer: git clone https://github.com/operepo/ope.git

5. Use the SyncApp tool to push apps to your online linux server (see instructions above)

## Manuall Starting Apps - On the online Linux Server

1. SSH into your online server (putty is a great tool from windows)

2. Move to the OPE folder: cd /ope

3. Move to the folder with the docker files: cd docker_build_files

4. Start the apps: ./up.sh  (use ./up.sh b  if you want to build the docker apps from here) 

5. From here you can also use docker-compose commands:
   - python ../build_tools/rebuild_compose.py  --> rebuilds the docker-compose file based on activated apps
   - docker-compose up -d   --> start up all enabled apps
   - docker-compose down    --> stop all apps


# NOTE - 6/7/17 - file structure rearranged on this date
Revising to use dockerhub to pull built images as well as include client tools/etc...
This is currently in process and could mean breaking changes to the prev build process.
