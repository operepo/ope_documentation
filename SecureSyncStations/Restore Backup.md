# Restoring a backup file

## Login to interface
You can get to the login page by using the gateway address (e.g. if your computer has an IP address of 192.168.0.34, the gateway address would be 192.168.0.1, or if you have an IP of 202.5.222.64 your gateway address would be 202.5.222.1).

Open a browser and go to the gateway address. Login using admin and the password provided by  tech support.

## Find the backup file
On the left side, find the "Files" menu. When you click it, you should see a backup file called "ope-backup.backup".  Click that and use the "Restore" button at the top.  Use the provided password.

## Reboot the Sync Box
After a restore, it will require a reboot. If it asks, tell it yes. If not, click "System" on the left and find the "reboot" option.

## IPs may change!
After the reboot, you system should get an ip address that starts with 202.5.222.???.  If you do NOT get one (e.g. if you still get an IP address that starts with 192.168.???) then the restore did NOT succeed.  If it did change, you should be set and future attempts to login to the system will need to be done at 202.5.222.1
